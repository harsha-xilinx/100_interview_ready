what is a fixed priority arbiter ?
A Fixed Priority Arbiter is an arbitration logic that always grants access based on a predefined, 
constant priority order among multiple requesters.

📌 Definition
In a fixed priority arbiter:
Each requester has a static priority
Highest-priority active request always wins
Priority never changes at runtime

🔁 Example (4 requesters)
Assume priority order:
req[3] > req[2] > req[1] > req[0]   (req[3] is highest)

If inputs are:
req = 4'b1011   // req[3], req[1], req[0] active

Then output:
grant = 4'b1000  // req[3] gets grant

Lower-priority requests are ignored even if they’ve been waiting longer.

🧠 How it works (conceptually)
Check highest-priority request
If asserted → grant it
Else check next priority

🧾 Simple Verilog Example (Combinational)
always @(*) begin
  grant = 4'b0000;
  if (req[3])      grant = 4'b1000;
  else if (req[2]) grant = 4'b0100;
  else if (req[1]) grant = 4'b0010;
  else if (req[0]) grant = 4'b0001;
end


| Feature    | Fixed Priority   | Round-Robin |
| ---------- | -------------- --| ----------- |
| Priority   | Static           | Dynamic     |
| Fairness   | ❌ Poor         | ✅ Good      |
| Starvation | ❌ Yes          | ❌ No        |
| Complexity | ✅ Low          | ❌ Higher    |
