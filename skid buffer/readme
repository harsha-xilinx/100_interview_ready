What is a skid buffer, can you share in details and later implement using Verilog RTL.
A skid buffer is a tiny elastic buffer inserted at a valid/ready (or similar) handshake boundary in a pipeline. Its job is to absorb one cycle (or a few cycles) of back-pressure from the downstream stage without stalling the upstream combinational path or creating timing/hold problems. Practically, a one-entry skid buffer lets the upstream produce data in the same cycle the downstream suddenly deasserts ready — the buffer captures that data so the upstream can see ready=1 again (if buffer had space) or so that downstream isn't forced to accept combinationally-driven data it cannot handle. It’s used a lot in streaming/AXI-Stream, network and CPU pipelines.

Key point: when is the buffer used?
The buffer in a skid buffer is only active when the bypass path cannot be used. That is:
* Bypass condition: buffer empty && source valid && downstream ready → data goes straight through, no need to use buffer.
* Buffer capture: buffer empty && source valid && downstream NOT ready → data cannot be sent, so we capture it in the buffer.
* Buffer forward: buffer valid && downstream ready → the buffered data is now consumed (forwarded).

Buffer empty, downstream ready
Source is valid → bypass. Buffer is not touched.
Buffer empty, downstream not ready
Source is valid → buffer captures the data (buf_valid <= 1) for future forwarding.
Buffer full, downstream ready
We can now forward the buffered data to downstream.
If source is also valid in the same cycle → consume buffer AND capture new incoming data (this is the “consume + refill” behavior).
Buffer full, downstream not ready
Buffer holds data → do nothing, wait.

| Use case   | Timing fix  | Elastic buffering |
| Cost       | Very low    | Higher            |

1️⃣1️⃣ Common interview questions
Q1: Why not always use a FIFO?
FIFO adds latency and area. Skid buffer solves the specific late-ready problem with minimal cost.

Q2: Can skid buffer overflow?
No, it only stores one beat. If downstream stalls longer, input is back-pressured.

Q3: Where exactly do you place it?
At ready/valid boundaries where ready is combinational and valid is registered.

1️⃣2️⃣ One-liner definition (for interview)
“A skid buffer is a single-entry buffer used in ready/valid interfaces to safely absorb one cycle of data when back-pressure is asserted late, preventing data loss without impacting throughput.”
