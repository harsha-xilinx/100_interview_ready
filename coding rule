🔥 How to decide in just 5 questions (real Qualcomm checklist)

Ask yourself:
Q1: Does the logic require multiple steps in time?

YES → FSM

NO → normal RTL

Q2: Do outputs change based on “previous cycle decisions”?

YES → FSM

NO → datapath

Q3: Do I need to wait for something? (ready/valid, done, busy)

YES → FSM

NO → pure combinational/sequential

Q4: Do I have more than 3 nested if/else conditions?

YES → probably an FSM hiding in there.

Q5: Could I draw my design as a flowchart?

If yes → it’s naturally an FSM.

🏆 Examples to make it crystal clear
1️⃣ SYSTOLIC ARRAY

No FSM inside PEs

Just pipeline registers

2️⃣ MATRIX CONTROLLER

Needs FSM (load → compute → drain)

3️⃣ FIFO

No FSM

Just pointer logic

4️⃣ SPI Master

Definitely FSM
(stages: idle → load → shift bits → stop)

5️⃣ ALU

No FSM

Pure combinational

6️⃣ UART Receiver

FSM
(start bit → shift → stop bit)

  | Situation                  | FSM? | Why                      |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------ |
| Multi-step control         | ✔️   | Must sequence operations |
| Protocol handling          | ✔️   | Start/stop/ack states    |
| Repetitive dataflow        | ❌    | No state transitions     |
| Pipelines                  | ❌    | Continuous flow          |
| Conditional flow           | ✔️   | Perfect FSM use          |
| Simple combinational block | ❌    | No state needed          |
